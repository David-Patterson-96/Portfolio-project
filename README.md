# Portfolio-project

This is my web design portfolio project for the Beginning Dreamweaver class I attended at Copper Mountain Community College which was heavily inspired by the Halo video games. This website features a fluid grid layout for mobile decides & desktops along with custom assets & videos that I created in Adobe Photoshop & Premiere Pro, and a form page with a table with hidden fields, text fields with maxlength attributes, a check box group, a menu list, a text area field, a submit & reset button.
