	  <p class="paragraph_text"><span class="bullet_term" id="forerunner">Foreruner</span> - Before the great fall, my people were proud rulers of the galaxy as we uphold the role of caretakers for all inhabitants within our space. This all changed when the humans attacked our colonies resulting in a thousand year. Little did we known that the humans were cleansing our worlds of unimaginable threat: a race of space zombie parasites known only as the Flood. After the Human-Forerunner War ended, our three hundred war with the space zombies had begun shortly after. This war my people were nearly extinct with only me as the sole survivor left behind to rebuild an empire of a forgotten kind.</p>

<p class="paragraph_text"><span class="bullet_term" id="covenant">Covenant</span> - A collection of many alien species formed under a religion that worships the relics of my people that were left behind after our passing. They engaged in a 27 year war with the humans and lost with only remnants of this mighty empire being all that remains after it fell. Some of the remnants setting their sights for peace with the humans while others seek to continue their holy war against them.</p>

<p class="paragraph_text"><span class="bullet_term" id="unsc">United Nations Space Command (UNSC)</span> -After humanity was brought into a new age of space faring, almost 100,000 years after the fall of the Forerunners, the UNSC is the predominant human government who oversees planet colonization and military power in human space. As civil war boiled between the UNSC and its colonies, the Covenant found and attacked the human farming world of Harvest sparking a war between humanity and the advanced alien collective. After nearly 30 years of crushing defeat after crushing defeat, humanity found one of my people's relics, a giant ringworld superweapon called Halo, and with the long hidden knowledge found within the ring, the humans manage to bring the Covenant's empire to its keens. After the Covenant war, humanity began to rebuild what has been lost and searches for other artifacts from my people to become more powerful in an unforgiving galaxy.</p>

    <p class="paragraph_text"><span class="bullet_term" id="flood">The Flood</span> - Space zombies that formed from the corrupted remains of the galaxy's creators, the Precursors. When awoken these creatures will stop at nothing to consume all lifeforms within its reach. As it infects host, it mutates the body to its needs and gain the host's intelligence. Once the infection reaches a critical mass, they begin to form a central intelligence called a Gravemind which controls all Flood forces. As the Flood spreads, the more intelligent it becomes and the Gravemind will use this knowledge to find more civilizations to feast upon. These nightmare creatures single-handedly brought the Forerunner Ecumene to its keens in a 300 year galactic scale war with our last resort for victory was starve them by wiping out all life in the galaxy with the use a mega superweapons called Halo. This the most dangerous creature in all of creation and should never be treated lightly.</p>
