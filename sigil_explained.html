<p>Sigils are symbols that represent an individual Forerunner, AI construct, or an entity ouside of the Forerunner Ecumene. An sigil also represents the status of the entity. The sigils that lies before you repesent my status in the Forerunner hierarchy before and after the firing of the Halos around 100,000 BC.<br>
  <br>
  Blue repersents my old "Iso" status denoting my leadership and authority over all Prothmentan forces as the highest ranking position within the Ecumene's military.<br>
  <br>
  Red respersents my current "Unbound" status after my liberation from Requiem's core and regaining control of the dormant Prothmentan robots in order to order to rebuilt the Forerunner Ecumene in my own image and bring peace to the galaxy. </p>
