	<span class="bullet_term" id="beginnings">This is How it all Begains</span> - Around 15,000,000 BC, an ancient extragalactic race known as the Precursors seeded the galaxy with life, ultimately leading to the creation of the Forerunners, human, and other intelligent species. By 10,000,000 BC, the Forerunners were tested to see if they were worthy to uphold the Precursors' Mantle of Responsibility, a belief in which the most advanced species should be the caretakers and keepers of peace to all civilizations within the galaxy. They failed and Precursors choose humanity to be the new inheritor to the Mantle as they set forth plans of wipe out the Forerunners. The Forerunners learned of the Precursors' plans and began a war against driving the Precursors out of the galaxy with the Forerunners believing the Precursors were extinct.</p>

During the year 107,445 BC, the humans find crashed vessels that contain an organic powder. They and San'Shyuum administered the powder to animal known as the Pheru which made the creatures more docile. Unbeknownst to them the powder was actually the corrupted remains of the Precursors, who reduce themselves into powder form with plans to regenerate themselves later on in a last ditch effort to save their kind from extinction from the Forerunner wrath, and was altering the Pheru's genetic makeup. Centuries later, the Pheru mutated and cannibalize each other spreading the infection to the humans and San'Shyuum creating a race of space zombies called the Flood. The Flood infection spread to hundreds of worlds and the humanity begins an all-out war to wipe out the Flood from the face of creation. When the humans entered into Forerunner space in order to contain the Flood infection, the Forerunner view this as an act of aggression and declares war with Human-San'Shyuum alliance. In 106,445 BC, the Human-Forerunner War ended with the Forerunner emerging victorious. The San'Shyuum surrendered, the humans were relocated to Earth with their civilization being regressed back to the Stone Age, and all records of the Flood existence where eased with the Forerunner believing that the parasite was a myth.</p>

It was the bloodiest in the galaxy's history as entire worlds were lost in hours, the most advanced artificial intelligence falling to the space zombies' control, and even turning willing and unwilling living being into weapons to stop the Flood's advance. After a thousand plans were tried and failed, the Forerunners created seven ringworld superweapons called Halo in order to starve the Flood to death by removing its food, every living being in the galaxy. In 97,445 BC, the Halo array fired wiping out the Flood and every living being in the galaxy including the Forerunners. After reseeding the galaxy with the life that was saved, the remaining Forerunners left the galaxy to never be seen again.</p>

The Sangheili executed the San 'Shyuum delegation that were sent to make contact with the Sangheili thus started the War of Beginnings. The War of Beginnings ended in 852 BC with San'Shyuum creating an alliance with Sangheili called the Covenant. For over three thousand years, the Covenant conquered many alien species in their quest of finding Forerunner artifacts in to locate and activate the Halo rings to complete The Great Journey, a regions belief that is the very foundation of the Covenant Empire in which the activation of the Halo array will transcend its believers into gods.</p>

In 2291 AD, humanity discovers faster than light travel in the form of the Slipspace travel thanks to the development of the Shaw-Fujikawa Slipspace Drive. By 2492 AD, humanity colonized over 800 worlds forming the Inner and Outer Colonies, but tensions began to brew between the two which lead to the rise of the Insurrectionists rebel movement. Fearing the risk of open civil war between the colonies, the UNSC begins an abduction of 150 children from the colonies in 2517 AD in order to have suitable candidates for the Spartan II super solider program to ease the tensions. By 2525, only 33 candidates survived the augmentation procedures with the rest either being physically deformed to perform active combat roles or dead.</p>

For 28 years, the UNSC and the surviving Spartan II candidates engage in ground and space combat against Covenant forces. Despite a handful of victories, humanity was losing the war and face extinction as the Covenant pushed their way into UNSC space to find Earth and burning every human world in their way.</p>

Little did he known that he was being tricked by ancient being known as the Derderct, the last living Forerunner and leader of the fallen empire's Prothmentan military forces, into releasing him from his imprisonment in the planet's core that the Forerunners had left him in for over 100,000 years.

Master Chief John-117 manage to sneak aboard the ship as it was leaving Requiem. The Derderct's campaign started at a UNSC research station near Halo Installation 03 to recover a Forerunner device known as the Composer, a device that turn organic beings into data for the production of Prothmentan robots, that the humans were studying in order use the device on the Earth and turn its human population into Prothmentan robots. Master Chief warned the station of the Derderct's plan but failed to stop the Prothmentan forces from capturing the Composer and using it on the station. With the Composer in the Derderct's hand, he then set his sights towards Earth and the Master Chief made it his top priority to stop the Derderct at all cost. While Master Chief was successful at defeating the Derderct and destroying the Composer along with the Mantle's Approach, he failed to stop him from using the composer on the city of New Phoenix and turning its population of seven million into new Prothmentan robots for the Derderct's army.</p>

Many of these of old flames that flocked to the Derderct were powerful Sangheili shipmasters and politicians who disagree with their leaders forging peace with the humans at the end of the Human-Covenant War and Covenant warlords across all species from the ill-fated empire who wanted revenge on humanity for the near destruction of their species, religious beliefs, and civilization after the Covenant’s collapse. The rejuvenated remnants of the fallen Covenant Empire, whether the reason be that of religious, political, or personal vendetta, began to unite under a shared goal: the complete extermination of humanity in the galaxy. With the forces of this new fanatical Covenant Empire at his command, Derderct sent them to Requiem to complete unfinished task and to fight the UNSC forces on the Shield World as he dealt with the business of creating new Prothmentan robots out of the composed seven million humans from his attack on New Phoenix in the Composer's Forge located on Halo Installation 03.</p>

However this cause both sides to be at a standstill as they deny either side to gain the upper hand such as the Covenant remnants ordering the self-destruction of Requiem by forcing it on a collision course with its local star in order to keep its wealth of knowledge from falling to the humans. As the powers of both seemed to be locked in place, ancient powerful Forerunner constructs known as Guardians began to awake and arise at every point of the galaxy. Because of the Guardians' resurgence, Derderct began to lose control of the Prothmentans and they started to turn on their Covenant remnant allies, destroying the Covenant remnants' allegiance to the Derderct in the progress. At the same time, the human AI began to rebel against their creators and forming their faction under the banner of the Created, leaving both sides powerless to fight this emerging superpower. As of now, the reason behind the Guardians' revival remains a mystery and the fate of the galaxy is now uncertain.</p><br>
